# Preface

This is Preview 2 of the revised edition of this book. 

- Chapters 1-4 have been reviewed and many changes have been made following reviewer feedback.
- Chapters 5-8 are ready for review

This book is written in English. As a result, there may appear to be spelling mistakes for those who have their dictionaries set to American.

A reviewer's job is to advise on where the book can be improved, as well as to point out errors. The easiest way to do this is to open the .pdf file in Adobe Acrobat Reader, use the Comments system, and email the modified .pdf back to me. 

This revised edition of the book will be released in the second week of July 2022. It will be available as a free download from LeanPub.

## Who should read this book

This book is targeted at folks wanting to learn F# and assumes that the reader has no real knowledge of F# or functional programming. Some programming experience, particularly in C# or VB.NET, may be useful but not absolutely necessary.

## Thanks

Thanks to the reviewers of this revised edition (Gianni Bossini, Flavio Colavecchia, David Dawkins, Mauricio Magni, Almir Mesic, Simon Painter, Sanket Patel, and Eric Potter) for helping to add some sparkle to the rough diamond I created. 

Thanks to the reviewers of the original release of the book (Yeray Cabello, Emiliano Conti, Martin Fuß, Erle Granger II, Viacheslav Koryagin, and Cédric Rup) without whom it would have been a longer and more tortuous delivery.

Thanks to Dustin Moris Gorski for [Giraffe](<https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe>), Krzysztof Cieślak and Chet Husk for their work on [ionide-fsharp](<https://ionide.io/>), the various people who have worked on the language and compilers over the years, and finally, last but not least, [Don Syme](<https://twitter.com/dsymetweets>) for creating the wonder that is the F# language. All Hail Don Syme!

## About the author

Ian Russell has over 25 years of experience as a software developer in the UK. He has held many technical roles over the years but made the decision many years ago that he could do the most good by remaining 'just a software developer'. Ian works remotely from the UK for Trustbit, a software solutions provider based in Vienna, on a cloud-based GPS aggregator for a logistics company written mostly in F#. Ian's .NET journey started with C# 1.1 in 2003 and he started playing in his own time with F# in 2010. He has been a regular speaker at UK user groups and conferences since 2009.
