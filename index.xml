      <description>My name is Ian and I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer with over 25 years of experience, most of it in the .NET (Core) space. I have been using C# since 2003 and F# since 2012. I have been a regular presenter at .NET User Groups and community conferences around the UK, mainly talking about F#, functional programming, and Domain-Driven Design.
I&amp;rsquo;m the author of a free ebook, Essential F#, which you can download from https://leanpub.</description>
